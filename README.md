 ## Preparing for the Tutorials: follow the steps below to setup the Ipython notebook

 - In a browser page, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
 - If needed log in with your Google Account and select the tab "Github" from the prompt menu. Search for "UZHMLWorkshop2020-GAN"
 - In order to test the environment that will be used throughout this workshop access and execute the test_environment.ipynb notebook.
   This will download the data and allow you to import utils.py in the notebook.
 - Make sure this worked and report if any troubles arise.
 
### Using a GPU

In order to speed up training, we can even use GPUs! Select on "Runtime"->"Change Runtime Type" and then select the "Hardware Accelerator" to be a GPU. Connect again in case it does not do automatically.

## Data

The data is stored in a cloud and can be accessed via (alternative downloads also available, check out the notebooks):

You don't have to download the data directly but it's done automatically in the notebook.
