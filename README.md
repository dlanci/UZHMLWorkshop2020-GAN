 ## Preparing for the Tutorials

 - Follow the steps below to setup the Ipython notebook
 - Run the first lines, including the line starting with the `!wget` command and the `!git clone` command. This will download the data and allow you to import utils.py in the notebook.
 - Make sure this worked and report if any troubles arise
 
## Google Colab Setup

In order to run the tutorials, it is recommended to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
Open the link (if needed log yourself in) and select the tab "Github". There, search for "zurich-ml/MISiS2019ANN"
and four Ipython Notebooks should show up. One is from the lecture and with "_solution" is the same notebook "with a solution". Click on them and the notebook will open.

### Using a GPU

In order to speed up training, we can even use GPUs! Select on "Runtime"->"Change Runtime Type" and then select the "Hardware Accelerator" to be a GPU. Connect again in case it does not do automatically.

## Data

The data is stored in a cloud and can be accessed via (alternative downloads also available, check out the notebooks):

You don't have to download the data directly but it's done automatically in the notebook.
